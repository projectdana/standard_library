Building a language like this wouldn't be possible without a huge amount of work from others. Our standard library is built on open-source native libraries written by a lot of different people.

Behind the scenes, our current set of libraries uses:

SDL2 (windows and graphics)
Miniaudio (audio playback and capture)
STBVorbis (OGG Vorbis audio decoding)
OpenSSL (TLS, AES, RSA implementations)
MySQL Client (MySQL driver)
libpng (PNG image encoding)
libjpg (JPEG image encoding)
zlib (compression algorithm)
