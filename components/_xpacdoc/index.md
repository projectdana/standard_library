## Dana API

This is the Dana API documentation, which provides information about how to use every interface in the standard library.

There are two different ways to view this documentation: as a flat list of all interfaces, or as a package hierarchy. You can select which view you prefer on the left panel.

Some packages also have package-level documentation which includes examples and tutorials of how to use the APIs in that package; this package-level documentation is most easily accessed in the package hierarchy view.

This documentation is automatically generated from the Dana source code. You can generate a local copy on your own computer by opening a terminal window in your `(dana home)/components` directory and typing `dana docgen`. This command generates the documentation in a directory called `_docs`.
