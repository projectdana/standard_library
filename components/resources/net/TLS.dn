/* {"description" : "This API supports transport layer security (TLS), historically known as a 'secure socket layer'. There are two parts of making secure connections: authentication and encryption. This API creates an encrypted channel by using X509 certificates as public keys to initiate a session key exchange. It also performs part of authentication, by verifying that a certificate is trusted. The other core part of authentication is host name verification, which checks that the server you are talking to actually matches that which the certificate has been issued for; host name verification is left to the programmer to do separately as it can be protocol-specific."} */
